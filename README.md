In this project, I undertook a compelling data analysis endeavor using SQL Server and Power BI for a pizza business. The SQL Server database seamlessly captured customer orders, and Power BI transformed this data into interactive visuals. From tracking revenue to identifying top-selling pizzas and understanding weekly and monthly ordering trends, the project provided practical insights. This hands-on experience showcased my ability to navigate data, create meaningful visualizations, and derive actionable insights, illustrating my proficiency in leveraging key tools for impactful data analysis in real-world scenarios.

## 5. What Problems Project Helps To Solve

1. The use of aggregation functions to extract monthly trends and calculate the % of sales per order / category lays a foundation for strategic decision-making
   - Analyzing the daily trend for total orders can reveal patterns, spikes, or declines.
   - Aids in understanding daily demand fluctuations, helping to optimize inventory management and resource allocation.
2. Perform calculation in sales by category or pizza size helps identify which product categories contribute the most to overall revenue
   - This insight can guide strategic decisions such as focusing marketing efforts on high-performing categories or optimizing product offerings.
   - Provide useful information for refining and fine-tuning product offerings and enhance overall profitability.
3. Top 5 Products help recognize the best and worst product's performace
   - **Profitability**: Identify if the product is a profit center or a cost center.
   - **Brand Impact**: Consider how the product's performance influences the overall perception of the brand. Assess if discontinuation might impact customer trust.
   - **Cost of Discontinuation**: Estimate the costs associated with discontinuing the product, including potential write-offs, inventory adjustments, and employee considerations.

**Thank you for considering my application, and I eagerly await the possibility of further dialogue to explore how I can contribute to the success of your team. ‚ù§**
